## Animated Website

This sample animated website was created using Web Animation API and React Hooks. This was achieved by the [Use-Web-Animation](https://github.com/wellyshen/use-web-animations) library, which exposes the `useWebAnimations` hook that has plenty of functions, properties and events to help develop highly-performant and lightweight animations. The library also provides a big collection of built-in animations (one of those is used in this application).

The sample Animated Website is available on *Surge* [at this link](http://animated-site.surge.sh/)
